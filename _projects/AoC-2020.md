Back again by popular demand is my analysis of last years Advent of Code problems. As part of a continuing tradition, as much as two times is a tradition, I used Advent of Code as an opportunity to build some familiarity with a new language. This years language was Rust, and while it's a language that I've been very keen on lately, it feels like it is very unsuited for competitive programming. Rust's iterators and more functional styled features were a real highlight of my experience, and I'm very glad that I have learned them, the focus on safety was a real speed bump in trying to solve problems quickly.

<h3>Day 1</h3>
In classic Advent of Code fashion the problems begin very gently. This days problem required you to find a pair, and then a triple in part 2, from a list of numbers whose sum is 2020. The obvious solution to this is to use nested loops to try each possible pair and triple until you find one that satisfies the condition. It is possible to do this slightly more effeciently by keeping a hash-set of numbers you've seen so far as you iterate over the list. Then when you consider a number you check if it's 2020 complement is in the set and break if it is. This way you can reduce the order of the algorithm by one polynomial degree, i.e part 1 to O(n) and part 2 to O(n^2). However, the naive brute force search is more than fast enough for size of the input set. This was a theme that I noticed alot this year, very few problems required you to push the performance far beyond the straight forward implementation. Even those larger problems could generally be brute forced with release mode optimisations in a few seconds.

<h3>Day 2</h3>
Day 2 was the beginning of the cruel and unusual input formats the plagued this year. It was not uncommon to see people complaining in Discord that they had spent significantly longer writing code to parse the problem input than to solve the problem. I was luckily able to afford most of this difficulty use Rust's Regex crate, along with the discovery of named capturing groups. As a side note I would strongly recommend named capturing groups to all frequent regex users, coming from Javascript regexes they have changed my life. The problem itself was to check the validity of a set of passwords according to a set of rules. In part one the rules related to how often a certain character is allowed to occur in the password, and in part two the rules indicate where in the password the character is allowed to occur. String processing is not something that is super natural or intuitive in Rust, but luckily the extensive iterator libraries meant the solution was relatively clean regardless. In particular, match and match_indices were the MVPs, with an honourable mention to fold.

<h3>Day 3</h3>
Day 3 was the first day which took an ascii art grid as input, a time honoured tradition. At this point in time, however, I was still struggling with the best way to read input in Rust. So far I only knew how to read input line by line rather than using the much more convenient read_to_string. This means that constructing the grid was slightly more awkward than it needed to be, but all in all was only a minor set back. This days problem required us to count how many "#"s were along a path with a certain slope, that wrapped around the width of the grid. The wrapping problem can be solved very neatly using modular arithmatic, then all that's left is to walk each line and count the "#"s. Part 2 just introduced more lines, so we only need to repeat the same proceedure more times. Although I didn't try to implement it, you could count all lines at once by iterating over each y coordinate and calculating the corresponding xs. This solution may be more "clever" but I'm not convinced it'll run much faster.

<h3>Day 4</h3>
This days problem was another string validation problem, but with passport fields as opposed to passwords. In particular we had to make sure certain fields were present in part 1, and that those fields had sensible values in part 2. I still hadn't cracked read_to_string yet, so recognising all the passport fields when they were spread across multiple lines was slightly challenging, but beyond that it was just a simple matter of splitting the fields into parts and writing regexes for the different fields. This problem was pretty disappointing, requiring alot of simple, tedious checking to solve, rather than any interesting algorithmic knowledge.

<h3>Day 5</h3>
Day 5 is a return to something a bit more algorithmic than Day 4. Here you had to work out the coordinates of a seat in a plane from a "binary" search description of it's location, for example "in the front half of the front half of the back half of the plane". Despite immediately making this connection I didn't realise until after that we could simply interpret the fronts and backs, and lefts and rights as binary to get the seats coordinates and instead calculated the bounds directly using a fold. I'm still pretty happy with how clean the fold turned out, using tuples to pass extra state between iterations in a fold was a trick I think I discovered doing these problems and is one I find very useful. Part 2 was just running part one multiple times and finding the missing seat, nothing too exciting here, just put all the seat numbers in a set, then iterate from the lowest seat number you've seen to the highest looking for the gap.

<h3>Day 6</h3>
We're back to a string processing problem on Day 6. In this case we are given a groups of peoples answer to a set of questions, each identified by a single letter, with one persons answers on each line. The task is to determine how many questions were answered by atleast one person in part 1, and by everyone in part 2. Again I still hadn't worked out how to read input and split it on a blank line yet, but otherwise the problem is just scanning each character and keeping a count of how many times that character has occured. Then you check the total number of characters scanned and the total number of characters that occurred the same number of times that there were people. Shoutout again to iterators and filter for making this second part very easy.

<h3>Day 7</h3>
It was at this point that I was starting to run up against my lack of knowledge in Rust. In particular implementing algorithms on trees, and graphs, basically non-linear data structures in general prove to be a point of contention as I keep working with Rust. This days problem was to analyse a tree of differently coloured bags containing some number of other differently coloured bags and work out how many of these bags ultimately contained a gold bag and then how many total bags a gold bag contained. To do the first part I flipped this tree so that the edges went from child bag to parent bag, that is a contained by relationship, and then did a BFS starting from the gold bag to work out how many bag colours contained gold, remembering to subtract one so we don't count gold itself. The next part of the problem, however, required me to also keep track of the tree in the traditional top down fashion, along with the weights of each edge, the multiplicity of each bag type. Once I had this structure I could just calculate the total number of bags contained within a bag by recursively calculating its children. All in all my implementation wasn't too bad, but I wish I could've simplified it a bit with structs and double linking for the trees instead of two big adjacency lists.
