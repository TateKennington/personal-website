Computer proof assistants have been a hot button issue, at least in my mind, for some years now. I’m sure you can understand why the idea of a program that could automatically check your proofs for correctness would be an appealing prospect for an undergraduate maths student. I was enchanted by the idea that I’d be able to leverage my knowledge of programming to get perfect marks in my maths homework, however, as is often the case, the reality was much crueller than the dream. Over my undergrad years, I made a handful of attempts to learn a proof assistant but was rebuffed by a general lack of educational material. I settled on <a href="https://leanprover.github.io">Lean</a> as my assistant of choice since it at least offered some kind of onboarding pathway, unlike something like <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a> which remains totally impenetrable to me. My progress through the Lean learning material was limited however, I found that the suggested book, <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">Theorem Proving in Lean</a>, far too difficult to follow as a newcomer to the topic. But things were different this iteration of the cycle as I also dug into some of the secondary book recommendations, including the titular <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/">Logic and Proof</a>. This book has proven not only to be a great introduction to Lean, but also a great introduction to the underlying topic of mathematical logic. This project will chronicle my endeavours to work through the book and complete all (read most) the relevant exercises.
<br/><br/>
With this project, I’m going to be trying a different format for the website. Instead of waiting until I’ve finished the project, which let’s be honest is ambitious, before doing the writeup à la Rlox, I’m going to try to give written project updates as they happen. Hopefully, this will make it easier for me to get content out to you, my loving audience, and also help make the projects meaningfully distinct from my blog posts.

<h3>30/05/2021</h3>
This first progress update will cover the first 5 chapters of the book and the exercises from chapter 3. I’ve already gone a bit off the rails and rushed into doing all the chapter 3 exercises in Lean instead of writing out the proofs in natural deduction. My initial plan was to embed some LaTeX rendering in the page and display the natural deduction proofs in the page alongside the proof in Lean. After doing some research on <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a>, <a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a>, and <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/latex-for-logicians/nd/">natural deduction packages for LaTeX</a>, I decided that wasn’t going to work very well, look very nice, and would essentially require me to program every proof twice. Luckily for you, all the proofs are available on <a href="https://github.com/TateKennington/logic-and-proof-exercises">Github</a> and are significantly easier to follow than the natural deduction equivalents anyway. 
<br/><br/>
Even though I’m only just beginning, I have encountered a little bit of the frustration of having to make my proofs completely rigorous that you often hear about with proof assistants. In particular, not being able to use some of my common tools, such as proof by cases, has been difficult, although I hope the book will build up to those as it goes on. At this point, it is difficult to picture how more complex proofs will come together, I know Lean has an extensive library of proofs but it is just hard to imagine how something like undergrad Linear Algebra could be expressed in Lean. Not that I don’t believe it’s possible but more that I’m eager to start proving more substantial results.

<h3>08/06/2021</h3>
In the time since the last progress update, I have read ahead to chapter 9 and completed the exercises up to chapter 6. In conceptual terms, this has taken us from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic">intuitionistic logic</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic">classical logic</a>, and from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">propositional logic</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">first-order logic</a>.
<br/><br/>
To make things a bit more understandable for those who haven’t been reading along or who aren’t particularly maths savvy, I’m going to try and give an elevator pitch definition for these concepts. In general, a system of logic is a set of rules that let us reason about the implications of facts. An example of this is the reasoning, if we know that vehicles can be blue and we know a car is a vehicle, then it follows that cars can be blue. In other words, logic allows us to manipulate and solve equations of facts, rather than equations of numbers. Different systems of logic offer us different tools for performing these manipulations. 
<br/><br/>
Classical logic is the system that you’re probably familiar with if you’re only passingly familiar with logic. On the other hand, Intuitionistic logic is a weaker form of classical logic, which notably doesn’t include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle">law of excluded middle</a>, or equivalently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negation#Elimination_and_introduction">double negation elimination</a>. In practical terms, this means that you can’t use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction">proof by contradiction</a>, as it depends on the law of excluded middle. This is appealing in a romantic sense, it means it’s not enough to prove that something cannot possibly be false to prove that it’s true(which may not always be the case), for example, if you want to show that a certain object you have to be able to produce an example of it. This is certainly more satisfying, however, after doing all the exercises I can tell you it’s much more difficult and many very fundamental identities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws">De Morgans’ laws</a> depend on classical arguments.
<br/><br/>
Moving onto propositional vs first-order logic, propositional logic, as the name might suggest, operates on propositions. In this context, a proposition is like the statements of facts we discussed earlier, and these can be combined into more complex propositions by using the logical operations: and, or, not, implication, bi-implication. For example, a car being red _implies_ that it goes faster _or_ it goes the same speed _and_ looks cool. First-order logic instead operates on some universe of objects that we are free to choose, so long as we can evaluate equality for those objects, such as numbers. First-order logic also adds, predicates, which take some number of our objects and gives us back a proposition about them, such as one being less than the other, and functions, which take some of our objects and transforms them into a new object from our universe. Finally, first-order logic gives us the universal and existential quantifiers, which allows us to reason about all of the objects in our universe or some arbitrary object with certain properties, respectively. 
<br/><br/>
With first-order logic we have enough power, at least logically speaking, to start establishing some non-trivial proofs. Lean itself is built around type theory which, as I understand it, is a more powerful system again. Going from the contents of the book, however, we spend a couple more chapters learning how to use our new toys before taking a tour of different fields of maths, using first-order logic in production, so to speak. At the moment I’m just rushing to gather enough working knowledge that I can start catching up on exercises and hopefully solidify my slightly fuzzy understanding of first-order logic up to this point.
